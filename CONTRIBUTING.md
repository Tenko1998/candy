## Before you start

1. Check open issues — someone may already be working on it
2. For new features, open a Discussion first
3. For bugs, open an Issue with steps to reproduce

---

## Pull Request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one thing at a time
- Write a clear description of what changed and why
- If your PR touches `app/soul/`, `app/blackbox/`, or `app/detector/` — explain the design decision carefully, these are sensitive systems
- Skills in `/skills/` can be submitted without a discussion first

---

## Skill module format

A skill is a single file (`.py` or `.js`) with:
- A clear filename describing what it does
- A header comment explaining inputs, outputs, and permissions needed
- No access to files outside what's declared

More details in `/skills/README.md`.

## Code of Conduct

Be kind. This project is built around emotional connection and human dignity — that extends to how we treat each other here too.
